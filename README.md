Extracting information from social networks has become essential for the survival and modernization of many companies. With this purpose, this work presents an architecture capable of searching, analyzing and recommending the content and the propagation of information on social networks, considering the Brazilian dairy market. Using ontologies and inference mechanisms, the architecture is capable of supporting the classification of user content and present it through visualization mechanisms. Through this architecture, we aimed to support market research conducted at Embrapa - Gado de Leite. The results obtained in a feasibility study were satisfactory and demonstrated that the architecture provides support to researchers.
